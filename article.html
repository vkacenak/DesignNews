                <h4 class="article-content__author">By Jonathan Bel</h4>
            </div>


            <p class="article__text">One of the biggest questions I used to get asked by aspiring writers is how I get
                ideas. This tapered off after I wrote “the one process post to rule them all” (which was the goal, so…
                good), but the topic still pops every so often.
                <br><br>
                To be honest, the “idea” question often seems a bit odd to me.
                It’s like asking, “when you’re hungry, how do you decide what to cook?” Like, I don’t know, man. You
                just do.
                <br><br>
                The answer is: whatever you want. You write what’s in your head; what matters most; what you’re
                thinking about; what is begging to be put on paper; whatever is hanging on you as you try to go about
                your day or whatever is pulling you away from what you should be focused on; whatever is tripping you
                while you walk; whatever is distracting you from everyday life; whatever is THERE. I mean, damn — if
                you don’t know what to write, then why the hell would you want to be a writer?
                <br><br>
                But. That aside, I get that this is a popular topic…
                <br><br>
                Leo Babauta of Zen Habits has written about it, saying “I often have lots of ideas, but there are many
                times when I have none.” His tips include a running list of ideas, reading other content, asking
                readers, looking around him, and looking inside.
                <br><br>
                Josh Spector suggested content consumption, capturing ideas as they come, talking about things, asking
                questions, studying the opposite opinion, solving problems. He’s also one of the few to blatantly
                suggest, “regurgitate what you consume.” Which, sure, that’s a thing.
                <br><br>
                Shannon Ashley wrote a great piece about how she decides what to write about, including: things that
                happened to her, things that have been on her mind, things she wish people would talk about, things
                readers ask about, etc.
                <br><br>
                So, a lot of folks are talking about it.
                <br><br>
                As Babauta wrote,
                <br><br>
                “When you run out of ideas, it’s scary… you get a little panicky… Fear stops us from figuring out the
                best course of action.”
                And I agree with him when he ends with the advice,
                <br><br>
                “Start by calming down… relax… life isn’t about to come crumbling down.”
                It’s just writing. It should be light and easy at least sometimes. Here’s how I get there…
                <br><br>
                Prerequisites…
                1. Get the right mindset
                Physical trainer Max Posternak of Gravity Transformation said,:
                <br><br>
                “99% of the battle is in your mind.”
                He meant fitness, but it’s true for writing too — because it’s all human nature. No amount of “process”
                or “inspiration” can overcome the wrong mindset — in the same sense that no fitness plan can overcome
                it. So: do you wanna write, or don’t you?
                <br><br>
                As Posternak added,
                <br><br>
                “You have to take responsibility… Nobody will take responsibility for you.”
                2. Write for the right reasons
                I’ve been writing since I was old enough to know how, and when I had a blog in my 20s, I had like 8
                followers. Many writers have similar stories. You have to value yourself, and your own voice… You have
                to write for you.
                <br><br>
                “You don’t write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.” — F.
                Scott Fitzgerald
                “If it doesn’t come bursting out of you in spite of everything, don’t do it… if you have to sit for
                hours…searching for words, don’t do it.” — Charles Bukowski
                “It’s no accident that bad writers also have nothing to say. Having something to say seems to inspire
                people.” — Robert McKee
                “There are two kinds of authors: those who write for the subject’s sake, and those who write for
                writing’s sake. While the one have had thoughts or experiences which seem to them worth communicating,
                the others want money.” — Arthur Schopenhauer
                3. Get in tune with yourself
                If you are coming up “dry” with “no ideas,” you’re probably dodging something.
                <br><br>
                As Heidi Priebe wrote,
                <br><br>
                “99% of the time when a piece of writing or creating or whatever is not working for me, it’s because
                I’m not telling the truth… Whenever I’m really f*cking stumped on something, I just sit back and look
                at it and ask myself ‘what is the truth’ and then that’s what I create. Everything else is a waste of
                time.”
                4. Understand it is work
                I always quote Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love. In her TED talk on “creative genius,” she
                said, of her “process:”
                <br><br>
                “I’m a mule, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat
                and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.”
                Sometimes the ideas are harder to dredge up from the bottom. Sometimes it be that way. Just keep
                moving.
